# Demo Store â€“Â seed

This package contains a complete set of seed and import files that will setup an Organization from scratch in less than a minute.

These are the same files that bootstrap our own [Demo Store](https://commercelayer.github.io/demo-store-core).

npm install
npm install -g @commercelayer/cli
